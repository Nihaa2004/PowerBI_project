# PowerBI_project
This Power BI project analyzes customer churn behavior in a banking dataset through interactive dashboards and visual insights. It covers key areas including customer demographics, card usage patterns, RFM segmentation, CLTV analysis, credit utilization behavior, engagement metrics, and churn risk identification. By leveraging various Power BI features like slicers, KPI cards, and Top N filters, the dashboard offers a comprehensive view of factors influencing customer attrition. The final part of the project includes strategic business recommendations in a PowerPoint format, focusing on retention, cross-sell, and credit strategies. This end-to-end analysis is designed to help stakeholders identify at-risk segments and improve customer loyalty effectively.
